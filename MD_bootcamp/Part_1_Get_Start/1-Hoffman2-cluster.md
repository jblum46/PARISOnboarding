# About Hoffman2

Hoffman2 is the supercomputer (or we call it "cluster") at UCLA.  
It is managed and operated by the Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE).

To run Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we cannot rely on our local machine because our jobs usually require huge computing power. So, it is necessary for us to at least have a Hoffman account and know how to connect and interact with your own computer.
